# Transactions

In a certain large bank, thousands of transactions are carried out on accounts every day.
These are both incoming (receipts) and outgoing (expenditure) transfers.

One of the bank's departments would like to know how the balance of all accounts changes after the entire day's transactions have been processed.
Additionally, it has a requirement that the list of accounts be sorted in ascending order.

It is predicted that in the near future, there may be as many as 100,000 such transactions as its customer base is constantly growing.
Our system must be ready for this!

## Task:
Write an algorithm that will process all transactions and return a sorted list of accounts, along with the number of credits and debits, and the final balance.
It is assumed that the starting balance of each account is PLN 0.

# ATM service

The service orderResponse system contains requests that must be queued for processing.
The queue is related to the convoy route through individual regions, and the designated route between the regions has already been approved.
There are a lot of service requests, as in addition to the standard and priority ATM replenishment works planned for today, other requests have also appeared that need to be handled.
One of such requests is a signal about a low cash level in an ATM, which was not planned for today.
Such a request should be executed immediately after completing the priority planned orders in a given region.
Another request is a signal about an ATM malfunction with which the technical team has no communication and cannot carry out the remote reboot procedure.
Such a request should be executed first in a given region. Priority planned ATM replenishment concerns devices where the trend of cash depletion is high.
Therefore, this operation is executed before standard orders.

## Task
Prepare a system that will prepare the appropriate orderResponse of service requests for the convoy group, assuming that:
1)	The convoy passes through the regions taking into account the increasing orderResponse of their assigned numbers,
2)	a given ATM on the service request list for the convoy group can appear only once.

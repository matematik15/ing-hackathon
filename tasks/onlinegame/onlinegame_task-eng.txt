# Online game

One great online game has recently become very popular and the number of players is growing at a rapid pace.
In addition to the standard gameplay, special events are held from time to time where you can earn the most points. Every player wants to take part in them.
Unfortunately, the platform on which the game is running has performance problems, which is why entering the event boards is done in groups.
In the game you can create clans, created from more players. Clan strength is defined by the sum of clan members' points.
The order of entering the special event depends on the sum of points of clan members.

Unfortunately, due to the above-mentioned performance issues, boarding is done according to the following rules:
- players are allowed in groups with a maximum size (m)
- players from a given group enter the board in turn, not at one time, which means that the best players will enter the server first
- clan members must necessarily enter together in one group to use their strongest weapon, therefore they cannot be split
- groups need to be optimized in such a way as to let in as many players as possible during one entry
- if the whole group does not fit in a given entrance, the next group with fewer points has priority
- if two clans have the same number of points, then the clan with fewer players has more priority (which means that the clan has stronger players)
- all clans must get to the event

## Task
Write an algorithm that for a given number of places in a group (m) and clans along with its size (l) and total number of points (p) will determine the order and arrangement in which players should enter the board.
The number of clans can be really long, up to 20,000.

The numbers take values according to the following ranges:
m=<1.1000>
l=<1.1000>
p=<1,100,000>

Conditions:
l <= m
